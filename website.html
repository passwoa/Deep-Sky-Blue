<p class="center">Hello UPenn Bootcamp! We're the Deep Sky Blue team, and here's a site we made to tell you a bit more about us!</p>

  <h4>Joseph Sparks</h4>
  <p class="card-text">Hi everyone! My name is Joseph Sparks. I'm a rising sophomore at the Arlington Career Center (right across the river from DC).
    I'm currently a Life Scout, working on Eagle, and do BJJ and Muay Thai during the week. One of my favorite things to do is watch basketball,
    and I also play in the winter. My favorite subjects in school are probably math and science, but I love history as well. I plan on pursuing
    aeronautics and computer programming for a career field.

    I chose the UPenn bootcamp because I'm taking a beginner computer programming course this fall, and I'm happy to say I feel well prepared!

  <h4>Nikhil Desai</h4>
  <p class="card-text">Hey everyone! My name is Nikhil Desai. I am going into my sophomore year at Scotch Plains, Fanwood High School in New Jersey. I have 1 sister and a super cute dog and my favorite subjects are also math and science. I deem myself pretty athletic and I do soccer, basketball, track and field, and fencing. I also love playing video games, some being Valorant, Rocket League, Osu, and Minecraft. I plan to pursue some sort of enginnering (I haven't decided yet) and I wanted to take this course because I really like coding and game developing and this camp has it all!</p>
