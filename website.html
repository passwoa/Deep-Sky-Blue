    <h1>Joseph Sparks</h1>
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    <p style="color:#000000;border-width:10px;border-style:solid;border-color:brown;"> About Joseph Sparks: Hi everyone! My name is Joseph Sparks. I'm a rising sophomore at the Arlington Career Center (right across the river from DC). I have an older sister who's going into her junior year.
      I'm currently a Life Scout, working on Eagle, and do BJJ and Muay Thai during the week. In the fall, I play football and in the winter I play basketball, but COVID messed up the schedule for those. Hopefully I can start this season normally!. My favorite sport to watch is definitely basketball, but football is my close second. My favorite NBA team are the Brooklyn Nets, and before you call me a bandwagon,
      I've been rooting for them since I was in elementary school. My favorite subjects in school are probably math and science, but I love history as well. I plan on pursuing aeronautics and software engineering for a career field, which both have some overlap in the production of aircraft.
      I chose the UPenn bootcamp because I'm taking a beginner computer programming course this fall, and I'm happy to say I feel well prepared!</p>

      I'm currently a Life Scout, working on Eagle, and do BJJ and Muay Thai during the week. One of my favorite things to do is watch basketball (go Nets!),
      and I also play in the winter. My favorite subjects in school are probably math and science, but I love history as well. I plan on pursuing
      aeronautics and computer programming for a career field. My dream would be working on next generation fighter aircraft for Northrup Grumman. Some of the technology they make
      is really incredible! <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/air/b-21-raider/">Here's the latest project they're working on!</a>

    <p style="color:#000000;border-width:10px;border-style:solid;border-color:brown;"> About Angie Abraham:
      Hi everyone, I'm Angie, and I am a rising sophmore from central Pennsylvania. In school, my favorite subject is math, and in my free time I like to read and play the piano. I also love hanging out with my friends and going outside. In the future, I'm thinking about pursuing computer science or computer engineering. Before taking this bootcamp, I had coding experience with Python. I chose to take this bootcamp because I didn't know a lot about coding in the front end and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed learning about how to make cool websites and games for myself.
