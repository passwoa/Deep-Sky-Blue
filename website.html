      I chose the UPenn bootcamp because I'm taking a beginner computer programming course this fall, and I'm happy to say I feel well prepared!

    <p style="color:#000000;border-width:10px;border-style:solid;border-color:brown;"> About Angie Abraham:
      Hi everyone, I'm Angie, and I am a rising sophmore from central Pennsylvania. In school, my favorite subject is math, and in my
      free time I like to read and play the piano. I also love hanging out with my friends and going outside. In the future, I'm thinking about pursuing
      computer science or computer engineering. Before taking this bootcamp, I had coding experience with Python. I chose to take this bootcamp because 
      I didn't know a lot about coding in the front end and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed learning about how to make cool websites and games for myself.

Although I like all subjects, these two in particular are very interesting to me. I plan on going further in depth with computer science and engineering and I would love to learn about it in college too.
