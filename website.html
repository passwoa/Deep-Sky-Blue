    <p style="color:#000000;border-width:10px;border-style:solid;border-color:brown;"> About Nikhil Desai: Hey everyone! My name is Nikhil Desai. I am going into my sophomore year at Scotch Plains, Fanwood High School in New Jersey. I have 1 sister and a super cute dog and my favorite subjects are math and science. I deem myself pretty athletic and I do soccer, basketball, track and field, and fencing. I also love playing video games, some being Valorant, Rocket League, Osu, and Minecraft.

    <h1>Joseph Sparks</h1>
    <p style="color:#000000;border-width:10px;border-style:solid;border-color:brown;"> About Joseph Sparks: Hi everyone! My name is Joseph Sparks. I'm a rising sophomore at the Arlington Career Center (right across the river from DC).
      I'm currently a Life Scout, working on Eagle, and do BJJ and Muay Thai during the week. One of my favorite things to do is watch basketball,
      and I also play in the winter. My favorite subjects in school are probably math and science, but I love history as well. I plan on pursuing
      aeronautics and computer programming for a career field.
  
      I chose the UPenn bootcamp because I'm taking a beginner computer programming course this fall, and I'm happy to say I feel well prepared!

    <h1>Angie Abraham</h1>
    <p style="color:#000000;border-width:10px;border-style:solid;border-color:brown;"> About Angie Abraham:
      Hi everyone, I'm Angie, and I am a rising sophmore from central Pennsylvania. In school, my favorite subject is math, and in my
      free time I like to read and play the piano. I also love hanging out with my friends and going outside. In the future, I'm thinking about pursuing
      computer science or computer engineering. Before taking this bootcamp, I had coding experience with Python. I chose to take this bootcamp because 
      I didn't know a lot about coding in the front end and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed learning about how to make cool websites and games for myself.
